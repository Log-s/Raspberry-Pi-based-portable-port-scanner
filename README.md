I don't think to have a real use of this, since I am not performing *on-site pentesting*, but it still felt like a good idea. I wanted to work on a project hardware related (like using a Raspberry), InfoSec related and with some programming (not only uploading a script on the micro-computer). This seems to check every condition so far. Let's see where it get's me ;-)


Features
-
* Different levels of agressivity (faster : simple results, slower : complexe results)
  * Fast : *to explain*
  * Medium : *to explain*
  * Slow : *to explain*
* Working on battery
* Storing the result in a clean way, to be analysed later on a computer
